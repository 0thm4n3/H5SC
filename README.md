HTML5 Security Cheatsheet
====

This is the new home of the H5SC or HTML5 Security Cheatsheet. Here you will find two things:

 * A collection of HTML5 related XSS attack vectors
 * A set of useful files for XSS testing
 * A set of formerly hidden features useful for XSS testing

## The XSS Vectors

The collection of XSS vectors can be found here: https://html5sec.org/
